# Testsweets [![Pub Version](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/testsweets)](https://pub.dev/packages/testsweets)

This package is a utility and helper package to the TestSweets product. It is the package responsible for syncing your widget keys to the database which allows us to provide the auto complete functionality when you script your test cases. It also has some UI helpers like the TestSweets builder widget that will overlay on the screen any of the widgets matching our naming syntax. This package also serves as the only way of uploading builds to Test Sweets.

## Installation

To start using the package you have to add this package as well as the generator which will generate the `AutomationKey` JSON for us to upload to our application. To do that we add the following into the `pubspec.yaml` file.

```yaml
dependencies:
  ...
  # Flutter driver is required as well
  flutter_driver:
    sdk: flutter
  testsweets: [latest_version]

dev_dependencies:
  testsweets_generator: [latest_version]
  build_runner: [latest_version]
```

## Setup

After the packages have been added we have to setup the code. TestSweets makes use of Flutter Driver to drive the test cases that we write. This means we have to enable flutter driver for the version of the app that we build that goes through automation. Flutter driver disables certain things like the on screen keyboard so to keep it all separate we'll create a new main file titled main_profile.dart. In this file we will enable Flutter driver. Once you've created the file main_profile.dart in the same location as you original main.dart file you can add the following code.

```dart
...
// 1. Import flutter driver extension to enable flutter driver
import 'package:flutter_driver/driver_extension.dart';

void main() {
  // 2. Enables flutter driver
  enableFlutterDriverExtension();

  ...
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

We start off by importing the required files, driver_extension.dart. In the main function we enable the flutter driver extension with the call to `enableFlutterDriverExtension()`.

If you want to add the profile to your run profiles you can add the following configuration into your VSCode configurations

```json
   {
      "name": "profile",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart",
      "program": "lib/main_profile.dart",
    },
```

## Creating your Keys to Sync

Next up we'll add the automation keys that will be used during the scripting. These are normal Flutter `Key` objects where the `String` value is formatted in a certain way. Go to your first view that will be shown in the app and we'll add a few keys to walk you through the process. Before we add the keys I want to share with you the format that we use to identify keys in your code base. There are 6 different widget types at this point.

- **touchable**: This is any widget that the user can tap to interact with the application
- **scrollable**: This is any widget that the user can scroll in the application
- **text**: This is a plain text widget that the TestSweets application can read. Used to confirm certain text on screen
- **general**: This is any widget that will have to be checked for visibility or anything like that
- **view**: This should ONLY be used for widgets that take up an entire navigation entry
- **input**: This is an input field that takes user input from the keyboard

We have a specific format for each widget key that is as follows, [viewName]\_[widgetType]\_[widgetName]. For view keys the [viewName]\_[view] shortened form can be used. Lets go over those parts 1 by 1:

- **viewName**: Is the name of the view without the word view in it. So if you're on the `LoginView` you'll write this as `login`.
- **widgetType**: This is one of the 6 types of widgets as defined above.
- **widgetName**: The name as you would identify it in a readable and understandable manner.

An example of this would be for an input field on the login view. The email field Key would be `login_input_email` and the password field would be `login_input_password`. The login button will have the key `login_touchable_login`. If any of the parts of the key has multiple words we'll use camel casing for the naming, something like `specialBoarding_touchable_forgotPassword`. With that said lets assume your first view that'll be shown is the `LoginView`. We can create some keys on the view and generate the automation keys. Open up your login view file and add a key to your scaffold.

```dart
Scaffold(
  key: Key('login_view'),
  ...
);
```

Then you can go ahead and add the keys to your `TextFields`.

```dart
 InputField(
  inputFieldKey: Key('login_input_email'),
  controller: email,
  placeholder: 'Enter your Email',
),
verticalSpaceSmall,
InputField(
  inputFieldKey: Key('login_input_password'),
  controller: password,
  placeholder: 'Enter your Password',
),
```

And you can also add a key to the button the user would tap to login.

```dart
 AppButton(
  buttonKey: Key('login_touchable_login'),
  title: 'Login',
  busy: model.isBusy,
  onPressed: () => model.login(
    userName: email.text,
    password: password.text,
  ),
),
```

Now that that's in the code we can generate the automation keys. Run the following flutter command.

```
flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This will generate a new file next to the _pubspec.yaml_ file in your project called `app_automation_keys.json`. If you open that file you'll see the following.

```dart
[
  { "name": "login", "type": "view", "view": "login" },
  { "name": "email", "type": "input", "view": "login" },
  { "name": "password", "type": "input", "view": "login" },
  { "name": "login", "type": "touchable", "view": "login" }
]
```

Once that is in your code base you should be able to run the testsweets command to upload the automation keys. See the following section.

## Indexed keys

In some cases you will need to generate widget keys dynamically during runtime. An example of such a situation is when you have to populate a list from a data source. To make sure each list item has a unique Key you might add the index of the item to the key. For example:

```dart
final List<String> restaurantNames = getRestaurantNames();

ListView.builder(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(8),
  itemCount: restaurantNames.length,
  itemBuilder: (BuildContext context, int index) {
    return Container(
      key: Key('browse_general_restaurantName$index');
      height: 50,
      color: Colors.blue,
      child: Center(child: Text('Restaurant "${restaurantNames[index]}"')),
    );
  }
);
```

Here the list will have items with the dynamically generated keys `browse_general_restaurantName0`, `browse_general_restaurantName1`, `browse_general_restaurantName2`, and so on. These keys will not be included in the generated `app_automation_keys.json` file and will, therefore, not be uploaded for autocomplete.

To have dynamic keys available for autocomplete in Test Sweets, we need to tell the `testsweets` package to generate fake keys and make those fake keys available for autocomplete. To do this, add a file named `dynamic_keys.json` to the root folder of your project:

```json
[
  {
    "key": "browse_general_restaurantName{index}",
    "itemCount": 50
  },
  {
    "key": "orders_touchable_pending{index}"
  }
]
```

When uploading a build, the package will read in this file and, for the first key, generate 50 automation keys where each automation key has "{index}" replaced with a unique value in the range [0, 49]. The same thing will be done for the second key but a default itemCount of 10 will be used. Once these keys are generated, the package will upload them with the rest of your automation keys.

When viewing your automation keys in the Test Sweets app, these fake automation keys will also be listed and you should see them marked as "indexed".

## Uploading automation keys and builds to the Test Sweets service

Once you have written your scripts you will need to upload a build to test with them. This is done by building your application in debug or profile mode and uploading it to the Test Sweets backend. To make things more convenient, the process of uploading a build also uploads the automation keys. Therefore, before you start writing test cases for the first time you may want to upload a build so that your automation keys are available for autocomplete. To build and upload your application navigate to the folder containing your `pubspec.yaml` file and run the `testsweets` package as follows:

1- create a new .testsweets file at the root of your project, this file must include three paramaters `projectId`,`apiKey`,`flutterBuildCommand`.
----example file:
    projectId=3OezzTovG9xxxxxxxxx
    apiKey=e3747a0e-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    flutterBuildCommand=--debug -t lib/main_profile.dart

2- excecute the following in the terminal:
```bat
flutter pub run testsweets buildAndUpload apk
```

This will print an output similar to the following:

```text
Running Gradle task 'assembleProfile'...                          180,4s
âˆš Built build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-profile.apk (28.1MB).
Uploading automation keys ...
Successfully uploaded automation keys!
Uploading build ...
Done!
```

You can also specify ipa for an ios build instead of apk. For a debug build specify `debug` instead of `profile`. Replace {projectId} and {apiKey} with the project id and api key for your project. These can be found in the settings for your Test Sweets project.

In some cases you may want to build the application yourself and just tell the testsweets package to upload it. This
can be achieved by using the `upload` command instead of `buildAndUpload`. You will need to pass the path to the
build you want to upload with the `--path` or `-p` positional argument after the {apiKey}. For example:

```bat
flutter pub run testsweets upload apk "path/to/build.apk"
```

## Downloading your builds from Test Sweets

Once your build has finished uploading you can open your project in Test Sweets. Click the `Select APK To Test` button and your newly uploaded build will appear in the list. Selecting it will download the build. The build is only downloaded once. The downloaded build will be used the next time you select it. Once the build has been downloaded you can then run your test cases.

## Using TestSweets builder

1. Use `TestSweets.builder()` function at the root level of your app to inspect all the supported widgets.
2. You can also use the `enabled` property to disable/enable the inspector.
